# School Statistics
With this program we will be able to know the percentage of students that have
passed a subject, or that haven't, as well as obtaining the list of names of 
students that have passed, that have not passed or that are enrolled in a subject.
We will be able to also know the subjects a student is enrolled in. 

We receive an input file (en Excel file), process it and we will be asked about actions
in the console. 

We will receive the answers also in the console (if we want we can pipe to an
output file).

The input file will have the data:
- Name of the student
- Last name of the student
- Subject
- Mark
- Year
